# Fullstack React Blog Project

## Description
This project has the following requirements:
- Combine front-end and back-end code into one repo
- Look into npm package as a way to run both `client` and `server` side-by-side
- Look into Create React App's proxy functionality to allow axios/fetch calls from the React code to access the backend without need for an absolute url path
- Define what data the backend API should respond with and what shape incoming data will take
- When both the front-end and back-end are ready to interact, look into using a root-level `package.json` file to set up scripts to simplify installs and to run both servers concurrently

This project utilizes JS and React to run.
