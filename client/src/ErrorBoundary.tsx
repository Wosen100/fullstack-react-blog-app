// # Error boundaries work like a JavaScript catch {} block, but for components. Only class-based (smart) components can be error boundaries. In practice, most of the time youâ€™ll want to declare an error boundary component once and use it throughout your application, or you may create separate error boundary components to wrap around particular, exception-prone sections of your app. Error boundaries do NOT catch errors for any of the following:
// - Event handlers (error boundaries run only on render; click events don't run then... use try/catch if needed)
// - Asynchronous code (setTimeouts)
// - Server side rendering
// - Errors thrown within the error boundary itself
